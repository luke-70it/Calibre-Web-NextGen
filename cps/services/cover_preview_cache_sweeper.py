"""LRU-by-atime sweeper for the cover-preview disk cache.

Walks :data:`cps.services.cover_preview_cache.CACHE_ROOT`, totals file
sizes, and evicts oldest-``atime`` files until total is under
``CWA_PREVIEW_CACHE_MAX_MB`` (default 1024 MB).

Designed to be invoked from:

* The ``cwa-preview-cache-cleanup`` s6 service (hourly loop — Task 4).
* Operator-triggered shell:
  ``python -m cps.services.cover_preview_cache_sweeper``.
* Programmatically (e.g. after a bulk delete in Phase 2's cleanup).

Design notes / non-obvious choices
----------------------------------

* **Resolves through the cache module, doesn't redefine the root.** Tests
  monkeypatch ``cover_preview_cache.CACHE_ROOT`` to ``tmp_path``; importing
  the module (rather than a value) makes the sweeper resolve that override
  at call time.

* **Single-pass, no locks.** Cache writes are atomic
  (write-tempfile-then-rename); a race where the sweeper deletes a file
  the endpoint just wrote is harmless — the next request just
  re-renders. Holding any lock across the walk would block reads for
  the duration of the sweep, which on a large cache is unacceptable.

* **atime with mtime fallback.** Linux servers commonly mount with
  ``noatime`` for performance. The cache module's ``cache_hit()``
  explicitly calls ``utime(None)`` on hits which forces both stamps
  even on ``noatime`` mounts, but a paranoid fallback to ``mtime``
  when ``atime == 0`` (filesystems that report a frozen zero atime)
  keeps the LRU ordering sane.

* **Skips ``.tmp-`` orphans.** :func:`cover_preview_cache.write_to_cache`
  uses ``NamedTemporaryFile(prefix=".tmp-", ...)`` for the
  write-then-rename dance. A file with that prefix is either an
  in-flight write (race — let it finish) or a leftover from a crashed
  write. Either way, the sweeper isn't the right tool to GC them —
  it would race the writer, and orphan cleanup is a separate concern.

* **Race-tolerant unlink.** ``FileNotFoundError`` during unlink means
  some other process (or a future concurrent sweeper) already deleted
  the file. That's success for our accounting purposes — count it
  as evicted, don't count it as an error. Other ``OSError`` subclasses
  (permission denied, read-only FS) are reported in ``errors`` but
  the sweep continues — a single bad file shouldn't stall eviction
  of the rest.

* **Bad env-var value defaults to 1024 MB.** A typo in
  ``CWA_PREVIEW_CACHE_MAX_MB`` (``"1gb"``, ``"-100"``, empty string)
  should NOT silently disable the sweeper, which would let the cache
  grow unbounded until the operator's disk fills. Falling back to the
  documented default is the safe failure mode.
